This website has been developed to showcase the projects I have completed over the past few years.

I have always enjoyed working in the industry and think that now is the time to focus more on aspects of development and design that I enjoy.

Why the name project responsive? In the past I was very focused on making responsive websites but now this is just a given in any aspect of development or webdesign. My ultimate goal is still to produce an original concept or idea and build it from start to finish.
