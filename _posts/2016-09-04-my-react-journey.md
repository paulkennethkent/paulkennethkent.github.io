I've decided to switch my focus away from Ruby and see if I can get my head around [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react).  I will try and keep to a weekly post cycle and see if can explain what I have learnt along with some useful links and resources i've found on the way.  <!-- more -->

My goal at the end of this is to release an app which takes data from the popular sports tracker [Strava](http://www.strava.com "strava.com") using their [API](https://strava.github.io/api). The closer I get to creating the app the more detail I will reveal about the idea.

I haven't learnt enough yet to write a full blog post so i'll just let you know the setup I currently have, the tools I am using and the material I've been suggested to read and watch.

My favourite text editor at the moment is [Atom](https://atom.io) created by the team at [Github](https://github.com/). They have some great packages and themes that let you customise your workspace. Here is my current configuration.

* [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) - great way to clean up your code
* [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet) - great toolkit for web developers, I haven't even scratched the surface of its potential but there is some great [documentation](http://docs.emmet.io/) on it.
* [language-babel](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel) - "language grammar" for atom, colour codes your React.js synatax
* [activate-power-mode](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode) - when you want to feel powerful when coding...
* [atom-material-ui](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-ui) and [atom-material-syntax](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-syntax) the BEST ui and syntax setup.

I've been pointed in the direction of [egghead.io/](https://egghead.io) by my work collegues using React. I have to be honest, I didn't totally connect with the presenter as it quite fast paced but I can see they have some great material on there. I also stumbled across a great youtube channel called [learncode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVTlvUkGslCV_h-nSAId8Sw) and he has a really good [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGABj2GQSlDRjgvXtqfDxKm5b) on React that I plan to work my way through first. I will need to brush up on my Javascript theory so I will be reading "The Principles of Object-Oritented Javascript" by Nicholas C.Zakas on my train journeys to work.

Hopefully by this time next week I will be able to explain some of the things I have learnt.
