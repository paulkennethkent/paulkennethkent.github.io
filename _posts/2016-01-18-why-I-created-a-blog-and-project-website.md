I have always struggled to find time to learn but after I took the the time to plans my days I can commit at least 1-2 hours a day to learning news things. <!-- more --> The only way that I seem to work is reward effectively is by creating a *reward system* for myself.

I am the kind of person that needs to busy. Yes I love a good holiday and you will find my on a sunlounger for long periods of the day in the summer but that normally feeds into the reward system. If it is not an active holiday I will still try to run everyday.

>Decide in your heart of hearts what really excites and challenges you, and start moving your life in that direction. Every decision you make, from what you eat to what you do with your time tonight, turns you into who you are tomorrow, and the day after that. Look at who you want to be, and start sculpting yourself into that person. You may not get exactly where you thought you'd be, but you will be doing things that suit you in a profession you believe in. Don't let life randomly kick you into the adult you don't want to become.
