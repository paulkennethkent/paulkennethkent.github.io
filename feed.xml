        <title>What drives me</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past when learning to code i’ve been an all or nothing kind of guy, where some weeks I would work solidly for 14 hours and others I would just do nothing.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Weeks or even months would pass and then the dread of not doing anything would set in. It was a really ineffective and depressing way of learning. It’s not that I didn’t want too learn, I was just not seeing the results I was expecting, which was stupid. The problem was for me that some people made it all look so easy on the surface, like they are naturals, like it’s the easiest thing to get into. Let me tell you, It’s not! Yes some people might be better than others but really what they should tell you that you have to put the hours in, through the good and bad times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Decide in your heart of hearts what really excites and challenges you, and start moving your life in that direction. Every decision you make, from what you eat to what you do with your tonight, turns you into who you are tomorrow, and the day after that. Look at who you want to be, and start sculpting yourself into that person. You may not get exactly where you thought you’d be, but you will be doing things that suit you in a profession you believe in. Don’t let life randomly kick you into the adult you don’t want to become.
&lt;cite&gt;— Chris Hadfield&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the only way that I seem to work to my full potential is by creating a &lt;em&gt;reward system&lt;/em&gt; for myself. My day generally consists of a few of these activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Running&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GYM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning to code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Football&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning Spanish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gaming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Netflix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am one of this odd people treats exercise as a reward, I think maybe it’s just a good release for me these days? Anyways nothing frees your mind and relaxes you more when you feel like you’ve earned it. The other great thing is the more you put in the work then the more difficult task you set yourself start becoming more enjoyable and rewarding in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of this work that drives me is the challenge of it all. It’s like a never ending RPG where you feel like you are constantly upgrading yourself with new skills. With all this new knowledge random ideas and concepts that I imagine they now start to become realistic projects that I can build myself… Well that’s my hope for the future anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are finding it hard to motivate yourself then I implore you to watch this &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/arj7oStGLkU&quot;&gt;tedtalk&lt;/a&gt; it’s very funny and and excellent take on procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;
