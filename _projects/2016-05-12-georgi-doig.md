### Description
Georgi Doig is an up and coming video producer. She contacted me to see if I could quickly create a portfolio website for her to showcase the work she has done before graduating. We decided the best thing to do was to use my existing jeykll design/build. So we modified the colour scheme and page layout to fit her needs and also created a nice video introduction page.

This is still a work in process and I plan to modify the template over the coming months.  

### Technology
* SASS
* Jekyll
