### Description

We created a set of tools to compliment the new Kerboodle support website. These 4 tools are built using Javascript and Bootstrap. Using this toolkit teachers, administrators and IT departments can use the system requirements check before purchasing a subscription, generate login slips for students, produce letters for parents and use the CSV checker to check CSV files before uploading students to the platform.     

### Technology
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
