### Description
I have been playing around with REACT over the past month. I produced my first real "app" after watching a  [lynda.com ](https://www.lynda.com/React-js-tutorials/Learn-React-js-Basics/379264-2.html) course. I've tried to take it a bit further and modify the original corkboard effect into a whiteboard.I also create a function that would randomly generate the colour of the sticky note.

### Technology
* REACT
* ES6
* webpack
