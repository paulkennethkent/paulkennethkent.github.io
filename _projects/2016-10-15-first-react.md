### Description
I have been playing around with REACT over the past month and as a result here is my first app. It is a whiteboard of sticky notes that pulls in the data from the [Bacon Ipsum API](https://baconipsum.com/json-api/). It preloads 50 notes with data, these notes are editable, moveable and can be deleted but on reload it will refresh the data and states.

### Technology
* REACT
* ES6
* webpack
