### Description
After creating the [Kerboodle support]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/2015-07-01-kerboodle-support-website) website we used the same template to produce the MyMaths support website. I worked with a colleague to recreate the workflow in Jekyll and change some of the design to fit the MyMaths brand guidelines. Whilst learning Jekyll for the support website I used my new found skills to create this very blog.
