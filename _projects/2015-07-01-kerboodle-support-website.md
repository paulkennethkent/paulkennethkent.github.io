### Description
I was tasked with creating a support website for OUP online education platform [Kerboodle](https://www.kerboodle.com) which caters for well over a million users. I was pretty much given free reign over the design and the functionality aspects of the project as it was something I was driving the business to build.

I wanted the website to be responsive and most of all clear, lots of white space, not too much noise on each page.

I created a sidebar nav which responsively becomes a top nav when the browser resizes.

Once the website was created we then transferred all the compiled code onto Alterian which is the company choice of content management system.  

### Technology

* SASS - This was my first project using this CSS extension language
* Bootstrap - a beautifully easy framework
* GULP - I used gulp to process my SASS, Javascript.
