### Description
I was tasked with creating a support website for OUP online education platform ![Kerboodle Website](http://www.kerboodle.com) which caters for over a million users. I was pretty much given free reign over the design and the fuctionaility aspect of the project as it was something I was driving the business to build.

I wanted the website to be responsive and most of all clear, lots of white space, not to much noise on each pages.

I created a sidebar nav which responsively becomes a top nav when the browser resizes. 

### Technology

* SASS - This was my first project using this
* Bootstrap -
* GULP - I used gulp to process my SASS, Javscript, build a ENV workflow
